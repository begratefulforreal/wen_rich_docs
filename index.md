# Welcome to the wen.rich Documentation

**wen.rich** is a next-generation platform for cryptocurrency launches and trading. We provide a single, integrated ecosystem where users can discover and participate in new token launches, and creators can seamlessly launch their projects with powerful, built-in tools.

Our mission is to bring fairness, security, and simplicity back to the launch process. We've built our platform from the ground up to protect users from snipers, eliminate complex "claim" processes, and provide project teams with the flexibility they need to succeed.

## For Users: Participating in Launches

We've designed the user experience to be as simple and secure as possible.

### 1. Getting Started: Your First Deposit

Before you can participate, you'll need to fund your account. We've simplified this into a single action.

1.  **Connect Your Wallet:** Securely connect your preferred wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare, MetaMask).
2.  **Find the "Deposit" Button:** On your main dashboard, you will see a clear **"Deposit"** button.
3.  **Transfer Funds:** Choose the asset you wish to deposit (e.g., SOL, USDC) and confirm the transaction. These funds are now available in your platform balance, ready to be allocated to any launch.

### 2. How to Join a Sale (ICO, GameFi & Fair Launch)

Whether it's a major Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or a niche GameFi presale, the process is the same.

1.  **Explore Projects:** Navigate to our "Launches" page to see all active and upcoming projects.
2.  **Review Details:** Click on a project to review its tokenomics, goals, and sale details.
3.  **Commit Funds:** Once you've decided to participate, enter the amount from your deposited balance you wish to commit and confirm.
4.  **Wait for the Sale to End:** That's it. Your part is done.

### 3. The "No Claim" Advantage: Simple Allocation

We have eliminated the most stressful part of token launches.

* **No More "Claim" Buttons:** You do not need to race to a "claim" button at a specific time.
* **No More Failed Transactions:** You will never have to fight network congestion, pay high gas fees for a failed claim, or worry about missing the window.
* **Automatic Distribution:** Once the sale finalizes, your token allocation is automatically calculated and sent **directly to your wallet**. You simply receive your tokens.

## For Project Creators: Launching on wen.rich

We provide a full-service launchpad designed to protect your project and build a strong community from day one.

### Feature: True Fair Launches

Our "Fair Launch" model is foundational to the platform. We ensure that **everyone gets tokens at the same time.**

This mechanism prevents a common problem where insiders or bots with high-speed connections can buy tokens before the public, create artificial price pumps, and dump on real community members. With `wen.rich`, the token distribution is truly equitable, building immediate trust and price stability.

### Feature: Advanced Antisniper Protection

Sniper bots are the biggest threat to a new token's health. Our platform features integrated, non-intrusive antisniper protection.

* **Blocks Malicious Wallets:** Our system identifies and blocks wallets using common sniping tactics, ensuring they cannot disrupt the launch.
* **Protects Your Liquidity:** By preventing snipers from buying and dumping massive quantities at launch, we protect your initial liquidity pool and foster organic price discovery.
* **Ensures Fair Distribution:** This protection guarantees that your tokens end up in the hands of genuine supporters and community members, not just automated bot farms.

### Feature: Custom Tokenomics

No two projects are the same. Our launchpad gives you the power to design your tokenomics exactly as you envision.

You can easily configure:
* **Vesting Schedules:** Lock tokens for team members, advisors, or private investors with automated, smart-contract-managed release schedules.
* **Token Taxes:** Implement transaction taxes for reflections, liquidity, or marketing wallets.
* **Supply Allocation:** Clearly define the percentage of tokens for the presale, liquidity, team, marketing, and community rewards.
* **Liquidity Locking:** Automatically lock a portion of the raised funds into a liquidity pool for a set duration, providing security and confidence to your new holders.

## The wen.rich Trading Terminal

The `wen.rich` ecosystem doesn't end at the launch. Our integrated, high-performance **Trading Terminal** allows you and your new users to begin trading immediately.

* **Seamless Transition:** Tokens acquired in a launch are instantly tradable within the terminal.
* **Professional Tools:** Access advanced charting, order types, and wallet management without ever leaving the platform.
* **Deep Liquidity:** The terminal aggregates liquidity to ensure the best possible price execution for all your trades.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**(Q) What chains do you support?**
> (A) [Please add your supported chains here, e.g., Solana, Ethereum, etc.]

**(Q) Is my money safe?**
> (A) Security is our highest priority. All deposited funds are held in audited, secure smart contracts. Our "No Claim" system also reduces your exposure to malicious contract interactions.

**(Q) How is a "Fair Launch" different from an ICO?**
> (A) An ICO (Initial Coin Offering) typically sells tokens at a fixed price before they are listed on an exchange. A "Fair Launch" is designed to distribute tokens to the community in an equitable way, often with mechanisms to prevent bots and ensure everyone gets in at the same "starting line." We support both models.

**(Q) I received my tokens but they aren't showing in my wallet.**
> (A) You may need to manually add the token's contract address to your wallet interface. The contract address for every project is always listed on its official `wen.rich` launch page.
